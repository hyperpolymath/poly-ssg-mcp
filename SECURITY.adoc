== Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities via:

* GitHub Issues: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/polyglot-ssg-mcp/issues
* Email: See .well-known/security.txt

== Security Model

=== Command Execution

* All SSG commands executed via `Deno.Command` (not shell)
* Whitelist approach for allowed subcommands
* Argument sanitization before execution
* No shell metacharacters allowed

=== Permissions

The server requires these Deno permissions:

* `--allow-run` - Execute SSG CLI commands
* `--allow-read` - Read project files
* `--allow-write` - Write generated output
* `--allow-env` - Access environment variables

=== Container Security

* Non-root user execution
* Minimal base images (Wolfi, Alpine)
* No unnecessary packages

== Known Considerations

* SSG CLIs must be trusted and installed separately
* File system access limited to working directory
* Network access only through SSG build processes
